Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct that's often represented as a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first few rows of Pascal's Triangle look like this:

```
       1
      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1
   1 4 6 4 1
  1 5 10 10 5 1
```

You can generate Pascal's Triangle in Python using nested loops. Here's an example of how to do it:

```python
def generate_pascals_triangle(n):
    triangle = []

    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(i + 1):
            if j == 0 or j == i:
                row.append(1)
            else:
                # Calculate the value based on the previous row
                value = triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j]
                row.append(value)
        triangle.append(row)

    return triangle

def print_pascals_triangle(triangle):
    for row in triangle:
        # Print each number in the row separated by a space
        print(" ".join(map(str, row)))

# Generate and print the first 10 rows of Pascal's Triangle
n = 10
pascals_triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)
print_pascals_triangle(pascals_triangle)
```

This code defines two functions: `generate_pascals_triangle` to generate the triangle and `print_pascals_triangle` to print it. You can adjust the value of `n` to generate and print as many rows of the triangle as you'd like.
